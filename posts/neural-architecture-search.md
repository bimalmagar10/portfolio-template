# Neural Architecture Search: Automating Model Design

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is revolutionizing how we design deep learning models by automating the architecture design process.

## What is NAS?

NAS is a technique for automatically designing neural network architectures. Instead of manually crafting architectures, NAS algorithms search through a space of possible architectures to find optimal designs.

## Types of NAS

### Reinforcement Learning-based

Uses RL agents to search for optimal architectures.

### Evolutionary Approaches

Applies evolutionary algorithms to evolve network architectures.

### Differentiable NAS

Makes the search process differentiable for efficient optimization.

## Benefits

- Reduces human bias in design
- Discovers novel architectures
- Saves time and resources
- Often outperforms manually designed networks

NAS represents the future of automated machine learning and model design.
