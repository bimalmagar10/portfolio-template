# Understanding Transformers in Deep Learning

Transformers have revolutionized the field of natural language processing and beyond. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the transformer architecture and its applications.

## What are Transformers?

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that relies entirely on **attention mechanisms** to draw global dependencies between input and output.

> **Note**: The original transformer was introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017).

## Key Components

### Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads

        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)

    def forward(self, query, key, value):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Positional Encoding

Since transformers don't have inherent notion of sequence order, positional encoding is added to give the model information about position.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature                 | RNN  | LSTM   | Transformer |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| Parallelization         | ‚ùå   | ‚ùå     | ‚úÖ          |
| Long-range dependencies | ‚ùå   | ‚ö†Ô∏è     | ‚úÖ          |
| Training speed          | Slow | Medium | Fast        |
| Memory usage            | Low  | Medium | High        |

## Task List

- [x] Understand basic attention mechanism
- [x] Learn about multi-head attention
- [ ] Implement transformer from scratch
- [ ] Fine-tune pre-trained models

## Applications

Transformers are used in:

- **Language translation** - Google Translate uses transformer models
- **Text summarization** - Automatic article summarization
- **Question answering** - BERT, RoBERTa for Q&A systems
- **Image processing (Vision Transformers)** - ViTs for computer vision

~~Old approach: RNNs were the standard~~ ‚Üí **New approach: Transformers are now dominant**

This is just the beginning of understanding these powerful models! üöÄ
